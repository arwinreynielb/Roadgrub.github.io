		It  has become common practice for consumers to "order out" for food,have it delivered to their homes, and "dine in." Historically, the suppliers of food  have tended to occupy only one location, and a customer's choice of a particular place has usually been based upon the quality of food and the time within which his order can be filled. In the case of franchised suppliers that provide a uniform quality of food, once the customer has selected a franchise, his principal consideration is the response time of the store that actually fills his order. You may now choose from Jollibee, Mcdo. Chowking and KFC
